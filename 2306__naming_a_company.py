LeetCode link https://leetcode.com/problems/naming-a-company/

You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company.
The process of naming a company is as follows:

* Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
* Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
* If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
* Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
* Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.

## Example 1

Input:
```
ideas = ["coffee","donuts","time","toffee"]
```

Output:
```6```

Explanation:

The following selections are valid:
- ("coffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee conuts".
- ("donuts", "coffee"): The company name created is "conuts doffee".
- ("donuts", "time"): The company name created is "tonuts dime".
- ("donuts", "toffee"): The company name created is "tonuts doffee".
- ("time", "donuts"): The company name created is "dime tonuts".
- ("toffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee tonuts".

Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:

- ("coffee", "time"): The name "toffee" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- ("time", "toffee"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- ("coffee", "toffee"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.

## Example 2

Input:
```ideas = ["lack","back"]```

Output: ```0```

Explanation: There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.

## Constraints

* 2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 10^4
* 1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10
* ideas[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
* All the strings in ideas are unique.
